Create a complete Streamlit web application in Python for a Social Amelioration Program (SAP) Eligibility Checker.

Requirements:

1. Load a pre-trained machine learning model named "eligibility_model.joblib" using joblib.
2. The model exposes a function or prediction method that takes structured beneficiary input data and returns:
   - Eligibility result (Eligible / Not Eligible)
   - A short explanation or reason summary (string or derived logic).

3. Build a Streamlit UI that collects the following beneficiary inputs:
   - Full Name
   - Sex (Male/Female)
   - Age
   - Barangay
   - City / Municipality
   - Province
   - Employment Status (Employed, Self-Employed, Unemployed, Informal)
   - Monthly Household Income
   - Household Size
   - 4Ps Beneficiary (Yes/No)
   - PWD in Household (Yes/No)
   - Senior Citizen in Household (Yes/No)
   - Solo Parent (Yes/No)
   - Disaster-Affected (Yes/No)
6. Househould Size
   - When house hold size is more than 1 have them input their name(Surname, First name, Middle name,relations to that person, gender, occupation, sector(A-F), Health condition(1-5))
   - with the legend for sector and Health Condition is 
   📌 SECTOR LEGEND (A–F)
Code	Meaning
A	Senior Citizen
B	Pregnant
C	Lactating Mother
D	Person with Disability (PWD)
E	Solo Parent
F	Homeless
🩺 HEALTH CONDITION LEGEND (1–5)
Code	Meaning
1	Heart Disease
2	Hypertension
3	Lung Disease
4	Diabetes
5	Cancer

5. After submission:
   - Display ALL entered data clearly in a "Submitted Information" section for transparency.
   - Call the eligibility_model using the submitted data.
   - Display the eligibility decision prominently:
     - Green badge if Eligible
     - Red badge if Not Eligible

6. Display a "Summary Reason" section explaining:
   - Why the applicant is eligible OR
   - Why the applicant is not eligible
   (Use model output is eligible or not but you must get that result and make a summary of why or why not it is eligible.)

7. UI/UX Requirements:
   - Use Streamlit layout with sections and headers.
   - Validate numeric inputs (age, income, household size).
   - Show warnings if required fields are missing.
   - Use Streamlit components only (no external frontend frameworks).

8. Code Requirements:
   - Use clean, modular Python code.
   - Include comments explaining each section.
   - Handle model loading errors gracefully.
   - Assume the model expects a pandas DataFrame input.

9. Output:
   - The app must run using: streamlit run app.py
